### *About the App*
Barber-Shop Booking is a fully-functional, ready-made barber solution with user authentication that allows clients to sign up, sign in, and book appointments with a specified stylist for a variety of services. As an alternative to relying on 3rd party booking apps like Booksy, Barber-shop offers entrepreneurs and shop owners alike the ability to book appointments directly with their future guests. 

Guests will enjoy a simple user experience with a calendar of options that drills down to an array of 60 min time slots, filtered by their preferred stylist. 
***
### *Technologies Used*
This application was built using the PERN stack: PostgreSQL/Express/React/Node.js. The database was created/managed using PostgreSQL (psql), in tandem with Sequelize as the promise-based ORM library. A RESTful API was created and called on using Axios. Front-end was built out using React (with Hooks) / Functional Components/ CSS/ & JSX. The web/server framework was built using Express. Additional developer tools leveraged were VS Code, Github, Insomnia, Postico, commandline CLI, and UX libraries.
